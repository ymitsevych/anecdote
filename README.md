# Jokes
Coding Task
## Description
There is a database with jokes which have been tagged by keywords.
Create an endpoint in scope of Rest API that recommends a joke of the day.
## Requirement
1. Use any SQL(relational) DB.
2. Use Symfony framework.
3. Wrap the implementation into docker.
## Background
Imagine this is a real task. It has to be a complete solution, including codebase and installing scripts, instructions. You shouldn't spend more than a couple of hours on solving it. If you don't have enough time for the implementation, just prepare a respective doc with all the todos and current limitations. 
## Notes
1. No need to implement persisting of data in the DB. It could be either a fixture or just an sql-file to execute in the beginning.
## ToDo
1. sql dump with jokes
